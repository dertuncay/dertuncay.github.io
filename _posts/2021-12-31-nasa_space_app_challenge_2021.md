On October 2-3, [Team Carso](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/identifying-risk-with-science-communities/teams/team-carso/project) (composed of Deniz Ertuncay, Gal Behar, Mehmet Asim Gumus, and myself) participated in the Nasa Space App Challenge 2021.  
The result of the hackathon is the **Landslide Tracker for the UK**, an idea for a machine learning-based project to identify potentially hazardous landslide locations. The ideas behind the project have been presented through a [presentation](https://sffornasari.github.io/UKLandslideTracker/) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyAbJT5ZmI).  
The project was awarded for the Trieste location and thus was one of the global nominees.
