Seismic background noise levels in the Italian strong-motion network \\
Simone Francesco Fornasari, **Deniz Ertuncay**, Giovanni Costa \\

---

We analysed the background seismic noise for the Italian strong motion network by developing the Italian accelerometric low- and high-noise models. Spatial and temporal variations of the noise levels have been analysed. Several stations located near urban areas are affected by human activities, with high noise levels in the low periods. Our results provide an overview of the background noise of the strong motion network and can be used as a station selection criterion for future research.
