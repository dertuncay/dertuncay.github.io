Analysis of impulsive ground motions from February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence\\

On the 6th of February 2023, a large magnitude earthquake (Pazarcık earthquake), Mw =
7.7, occurred in southeast Türkiye, which caused significant destruction in Türkiye and
Syria. Relatively large magnitude aftershocks followed the main shock, and after 9 hours of
the main event, another large magnitude earthquake (Elbistan earthquake) occurred, Mw =
7.6, on a nearby fault. This study analyzes the near-fault seismic signals from earthquakes
larger than 5.5 recorded between the main shock and the 31st of March 2023. More than 60
impulsive motions are detected in 3 earthquakes, mostly concentrated in the Pazarcık and
Elbistan earthquakes. In the Pazarcık earthquake, many impulsive motions are recorded in
near-fault stations with periods of up to 14 s. In contrast, in the Elbistan earthquake, impul-
sive motions are spatially distributed, with pulse periods of up to 11 s and at distances
greater than 150 km. Pulse periods mostly correlate with the magnitude of the earthquake,
but pulse probability models do not predict impulsive motions over long distances. The
presence of strong impulsive motions in vertical components is also observed. For both
earthquakes, peak ground velocities (PGVs) are larger than predicted by ground motion
prediction equations. The observation of long-period, large amplitude signals may indicate
the presence of a directivity effect for both earthquakes. In some stations, spectral periods
exceed the 2018 Turkish building design codes for long periods (≥1 s).
