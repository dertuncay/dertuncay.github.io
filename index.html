<h1> Welcome! </h1>  
<p>I am Post-Doc at National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS in Center for Seismological Research.
My research interests are mostly on the behavior of the seismic signals that are recorded at very close to the ruptured fault. I am looking for impulsive signals that are recorded at strong earthquakes.
<br>  
Furthermore, I am interested in machine learning applications on seismology.</p>
