<h1> Welcome! </h1>  
<p>I am Post-Doc at University of Trieste in Department of Mathematics and Geosciences.
My research interests are mostly on the behavior of the seismic signals that are recorded at very close to the ruptured fault. I am looking for impulsive signals that are recorded at strong earthquakes.
<br>  
Furthermore, I am interested in machine learning applications on seismology.</p>
